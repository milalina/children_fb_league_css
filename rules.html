                            <strong>DIMENTIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                            within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                            dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                            and older.

                            be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                            participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                            field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                            Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                            field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                            associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                            required to play all their games away.

                            which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                            This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received                            during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                            next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                            participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                            deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                            (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.
